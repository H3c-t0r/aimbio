## Command Line Interface

Aim CLI offers a simple interface to easily organize and record your experiments.
Paired with the [Python Library](#sdk-specifications), Aim is a powerful utility to record, search and compare AI experiments.
Here are the set of commands supported:


| Command       | Description                                                          |
| --------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`        | Initialize the `aim` repository.                                     |
| `version`     | Displays the version of aim cli currently installed.                 |
| `up`          | Runs Aim web UI for the given repo                                   |

### init
__**This step is optional.**__
Initialize the aim repo to record the experiments.
```shell
$ aim init
```
Creates `.aim` directory to save the recorded experiments to.
Running `aim init` in an existing repository will prompt the user for re-initialization.

  **_Beware:_** Re-initialization of the repo clears `.aim` folder from previously saved data and initializes new repo.
  **_Note:_** This command is not necessary to be able to get started with Aim as aim is automatically initializes with the first aim function call.

### version
Display the Aim version installed.
```shell
$ aim version
```

### up
Start the Aim web UI locally.
```shell
$ aim up [ARGS]
```

| Args                              | Description                                               |

| `-h` &#124; `--host <host>`       | Specify host address.                                     |
| `-p` &#124; `--port <port>`       | Specify port to listen to.                                |
| `--repo <repo_path>`              | Path to parent directory of `.aim` repo. _Current working directory by default_ |
| `--dev`                           | Run UI in development mode.                                   |
