## Explorers

### Overview

Aim enables powerful UI to explore logged ML runs and metadata.

#### Metrics explorer

Metrics explorer helps you to compare 100s of metrics within a few clicks.
It helps to save lots of time compared to other open-source experiment tracking tools.

Features:

- Easily query any metric
- Group by any parameter
- Divide into subplots
- Aggregate grouped metrics (by conf. interval, std. dev., std. err., min/max)
- Apply smoothing
- Change scale of the axes (linear or log)
