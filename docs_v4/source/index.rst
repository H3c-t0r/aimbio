**Open-source modular observability for AI Systems.**

Easily log, connect and observe any parts of your AI Systems from experiments to production to prompts to ai system monitoring.

At its core, Aim is an operating system for logs (link to the PoV).
Aim enables building and running any kind of logging apps. 

Aim comes installed with these apps by default.

- Logs discovery
- Experiment tracking
- AI Systems tracing

It's easy to get started with Aim - the default Aim is seamlessly integrated with all major tools.
Default apps can be used out of the box with no configuration required.

Aim can get really powerful as you build your own logging apps.
