Integration Apps
################

Just like any other Aim app, integration apps have a specific role in the Aim ecosystem: they are used to integrate Aim with other tools and frameworks.

Integrator apps sometimes act like connectors - for logging purposes and don't necessarily need to have UI components.
It's up to the developers to make those decisions at the end of the day.

ML & Experiment Tracker Integrations
====================================
The ML & Experiment Tracker Integrations are default available with Aim. 
These are a set of experiment tracker specific integrations that connect to the respective fraeworks and their trainers.

It takes one line to add these loggers to your training script and start logging your experiments to Aim.

It's plug and go. No need to change your training script or your workflow.
